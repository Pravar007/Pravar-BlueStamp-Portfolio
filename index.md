## **Milestone Three**

  This third milestone represents full completion of the stock project. This means full movement and full functionality of all the sensors on board. The robot is now able to be controlled by both bluetooth and a remote, avoid obstacles, follow obstacles, follow light, and display messages on the LED screen mounted to the front. The obstacle detection for the avoidance and follow features uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted onto a servo motor. This servo allows the sensor to turn and look in different directions for a clear path, or to find any obstacles in the way. When the robot encounters an obstacle in avoidance mode, it turns its "eyes" (the ultrasonic sensor) around to find a clear path, when it does, it simply turns to that direction and goes forward until it encounters another obstacle, where it repeats this process. The opposite happens for follow mode, where it looks for the obstacle, and goes in its direction. Depending on how far the obstacle is from the robot, it could either travel backward away from it or forwards towards it. The IR reciever is used to connect the robot to a remote, through which it can be controlled. The light following feature uses the two photoresistors mounted to either front corner. The amount of light they recieve determines the direction that the robot travels. If both recieve bright light, the robot goes forward. If one recieves more light than the other (difference should be significant), the robot turns toward the photoresistor getting more light until the two recieve the same amount of light, continuing forward when they do. 

  
  Some of the biggest challenges when building this robot were getting the bespoke IR remote libraries to work with the arduino program, and finding a battery with the right power output to allow the motors to function as intended. Next, I plan to modify this robot to possibly include a remote controlled robotic arm attached to it so that it could pick up objects nad be more useful in my daily life. I am also looking at adding a projectile to make it more like a tank. A possible cosmetic modification could be to 3D-print a shell that covers the tank tracks to make it look more rugged. Some key topics that I learned about while bulding this robot were arduino programming, component wiring, troubleshooting, and debugging.

## **Milestone Two**

  My second milestone with the mini tank robot is achieving full movement. This means both my motors operate as intended; in both directions and at different speeds. My goal for movement was for the robot to be able to move fully by itself, and be controlled remotely. I had a choice between using a physical remote to control my robot and using an app on my phone, and I chose my phone as the remote, which meant using the bluetooth module (TI HM-10). The code maps the button presses on my phone to the correct functions that make the robot move, as well as displaying an animation on the 8x16 LED panel bolted to the front of the robot. When the "forward" button is presssed, both motors engage at full speed in the same direction, when the "back" button is pressed, the same happens, but in the opposite direction. In order to turn - since the tracks themselves don't steer - the left and right tracks are spun in opposite directions; right going forward turns left, and vice versa. 

## **Milestone One**

  My first milestone with this project is finishing its assembly. The tank is built around a metal chassis to which the motors and the battery holder are connected. Four standoffs bolt into the center of the chassis, on top of which rests an acrylic plate that is home to the rest of the electronics. Standoffs rise from this acrylic plate to a servo motor attached to the ultrasonic sensor. Also attached to this acrylic plate is the arduino, one IR reciever, and two photocell sensors. Dropping down the front of the robot attached to the acrylic plate is an 8x16 LED panel. Bolted to the chassis are two free-spinning wheels, which are connected to the driving wheels by plastic tank tracks. The wires from the motors and battery holder are wired into the motoshield, while the rest of the components connect into the topmost sensor shield. Overall, the cable management on this robot is fairly neat and does not obstruct the function of any of the components.

  The TV-B-Gone is a small remote device that, with the press of a button, turns off any TV within a 150 foot radius. This remote consists of one  microcontroller, with five transistors, two 1.0Kohm resistors, three capacitors, and a battery holder for two AA batteries. The main parts are the four IR LEDs which broadcast the signal to turn off the TVs, the button, used to turn on the IR LEDs, an indicator LED that signals whether or not the device is turned on. Putting together this project involved placing and soldering all the components onto the circuit board, periodically testing that everything is working as intended. Once finished, a press of the button starts a broadcast of the most common IR codes for TVs in order to turn them off.

**Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.**

# First Milestone
For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
