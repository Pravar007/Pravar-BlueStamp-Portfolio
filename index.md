My second milestone with the mini tank robot is achieving full movement. This means both my motors operate as intended; in both directions and at different speeds. My goal for movement was for the robot to be able to move fully by itself, and be controlled remotely. I had a choice between using a physical remote to control my robot and using an app on my phone, and I chose my phone as the remote, which meant using the bluetooth module (TI HM-10). The code maps the button presses on my phone to the correct functions that make the robot move, as well as displaying an animation on the 8x16 LED panel bolted to the front of the robot. When the "forward" button is presssed, both motors engage at full speed in the same direction, when the "back" button is pressed, the same happens, but in the opposite direction. In order to turn - since the tracks themselves don't steer - the left and right tracks are spun in opposite directions; right going forward turns left, and vice versa. 

## **Milestone One**

My first milestone with this project is finishing its assembly. The tank is built around a metal chassis to which the motors and the battery holder are connected. Four standoffs bolt into the center of the chassis, on top of which rests an acrylic plate that is home to the rest of the electronics. Standoffs rise from this acrylic plate to a servo motor attached to the ultrasonic sensor. Also attached to this acrylic plate is the arduino, one IR reciever, and two photocell sensors. Dropping down the front of the robot attached to the acrylic plate is an 8x16 LED panel. Bolted to the chassis are two free-spinning wheels, which are connected to the driving wheels by plastic tank tracks. The wires from the motors and battery holder are wired into the motoshield, while the rest of the components connect into the topmost sensor shield. Overall, the cable management on this robot is fairly neat and does not obstruct the function of any of the components.

The TV-B-Gone is a small remote device that, with the press of a button, turns off any TV within a 150 foot radius. This remote consists of one  microcontroller, with five transistors, two 1.0Kohm resistors, three capacitors, and a battery holder for two AA batteries. The main parts are the four IR LEDs which broadcast the signal to turn off the TVs, the button, used to turn on the IR LEDs, an indicator LED that signals whether or not the device is turned on. Putting together this project involved placing and soldering all the components onto the circuit board, periodically testing that everything is working as intended. Once finished, a press of the button starts a broadcast of the most common IR codes for TVs in order to turn them off.

<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

**Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.**

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
