A tank for the average household, as useful to you as the M-1 Abrams is to the average soldier. Controlled by a remote, it has the ability to follow your hand, avoid obstacles, follow a light source, and pick up items. It can do this using a suite of sensors, including an ultrasonic sensor, photoresistors, and an IR reciever. To pick things up, it has a robotic arm mounted to the rear, which is controlled by the same remote used to control the tank. The arm can swivel arond and pick up any small items like a TV remote and bring them to you. The arm uses four servo motors to allow for a full 360 degrees of reach. The brains of this entire operation is actually split in two; the main tank uses an Arduino UNO, and the arm uses a smaller Arduino NANO.
